Q: What is this stuff?

A: A GUI for OrpheusDL


Q: Is there anything worth noting?

A: Necessary items: OrpheusDL

And, I recommend that you go to your Control Panel and enable the "Use Unicode UTF-8 for wordwide language support" option. At least as far as my computer is concerned, if it is not turned on, resources containing special symbols such as "â™¥" and some less popular languages â€‹â€‹will not be downloaded.

Q: How to configure filesï¼Ÿ

A: First, go into your original OrpheusDL folder and press Ctrl+A to select all files, then press Ctrl+X to cut all files, then create a new folder named "_internal" in the original OrpheusDL folder, and then enter Press Ctrl+V in the "_internal" folder to paste all the files (that is, moved ðŸ˜„), then return to the original OrpheusDL folder, and extract the "_internal" folder and "OrpheusDL-GUI.exe" in the ZIP package to the original OrpheusDL file Just clip it in

This interface does not require any further explanation from me.

Each setting item in the "OrpheusDL Settings" tab is read from "settings.json" under the "config" folder, and the modified settings will also be stored in this "settings.json", that is to say , the setting items in this tab are all original OrpheusDL setting items.

If you change any setting in the "GUI Settings" tab, a "settings-GUI.json" will be generated in the "config" folder to store all the settings in the "GUI Settings" tab

(It is normal for the two Info boxes "Download Complete" and "Settings Update" to pop up immediately after you click the download button when running the application for the first time. Afterwards, you can download normally when you start the application.)
