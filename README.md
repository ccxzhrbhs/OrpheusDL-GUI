A GUI for OrpheusDL

Necessary items: orpheusdl

First, I recommend that you go to your Control Panel and enable the "Use Unicode UTF-8 for wordwide language support" option. At least as far as my computer is concerned, if it is not turned on, resources containing special symbols such as "♥" and some less popular languages ​​will not be downloaded.

Each setting item in the "OrpheusDL Settings" tab is read from "settings.json" under the "config" folder, and the modified settings will also be stored in this "settings.json", that is to say , the setting items in this tab are all original OrpheusDL setting items.
