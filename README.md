# OrpheusDL-GUI

A GUI for OrpheusDL

Necessary items: orpheusdl

First, I recommend that you go to your Control Panel and enable the "Use Unicode UTF-8 for wordwide language support" option. At least as far as my computer is concerned, if it is not turned on, resources containing special symbols such as "♥" and some less popular languages ​​will not be downloaded.
